## Assignment Instructions (20 Minutes)
1. [Install Python][python-install]
    * If installing on Windows, be sure to put a check in the "Add Python #.# to PATH" box.
2. [Install Node.js][nodejs-install]
    * Ensure that npm was installed by typing `npm -v` in a terminal or command prompt; you should see a version number such as 6.4.1.
3. [Install Truffle][truffle-install]
    * If installing on Linux, you may need to use sudo to overcome write-permission errors. If the installation completes, you should be able to ignore any of the remaining errors.
    * Verify the install by typing `truffle help` in a terminal or command prompt; you should see a help printout.
